# Z_TENNOT_IU

The first version of the interface is inspired by harmonic tabel note layout, Tonnetz, Browser GUI, WebMIDI Interface and Sequencing. You can use up to five fingers to play notes on the intervall grid. Theoreticaly you can use as much fingers as your touchhardware supports, but the internal polyphon mapping is limited to five fingers. Additional there is a sequencer that let you loop your input and modifie it in terms of time.
